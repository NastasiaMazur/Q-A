This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\\n\\n2.

All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor\\'s  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\\n\\n         2.2      Shipment.

The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer\\'s  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor\\'s                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor\\'s  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer\\'s  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor\\'s  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor\\'s   minimum.

The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company\\'s   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\\n\\n                                    Page -4-\\n\\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company\\'s  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company\\'s ability to deliver Product.\\n\\n         2.3      Delivery.
