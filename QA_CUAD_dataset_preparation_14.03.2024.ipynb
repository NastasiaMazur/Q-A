The cash royalty shall be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Net Sales Price of the invoice price of any Licensed Products and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix (the \"Liquidmetal Royalty\"). \"Net Sales Price\" is defined as the gross invoice price actually received by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees on the sale of Licensed Products, less returns or refunds, but before deduction of cash discounts. The Net Sales Price shall be commercially reasonable, and in no case shall the Net Sales Price be less than the cost of material consumed in a single manufacturing cycle, divided by the number of Licensed Products produced by such single cycle. The Liquidmetal Royalty shall be paid in U.S. dollars within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, based on payments received for sales of Licensed Products made during a given quarter.

From time to time, Liquidmetal may encounter, develop, and refer to Eutectix customer accounts for direct sales by Eutectix. Provided that such referred customer is not already a Eutectix customer, Eutectix may accept such customer referral, and in that case hereby agrees to pay Liquidmetal a cash commission based on a percentage of the invoice price of Licensed Products sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix, in addition to the Liquidmetal Royalty. The cash commission shall be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Net Sales Price of the invoice price of Licensed Products sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix (the \"Liquidmetal Commission\").

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars. 3.3 Cost Reduction. Eutectix will work diligently with Liquidmetal in an effort to reduce waste, enhance productivity, and decrease Prices through reductions in the cost of producing Liquidmetal Products, all without adversely impacting quality or delivery times. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Eutectix and Liquidmetal will work cooperatively and take advantage of cost saving technologies and other cost reduction opportunities to assist in maintaining a competitive cost position. The Parties shall meet on a quarterly basis to discuss specific cost reduction and productivity enhancement activities (collectively, the \"Activities\"). In support of these efforts, Liquidmetal shall provide to Eutectix its own estimates of direct sales costs, including commissions, inspections, modifications, inventory, repackaging, shipping/receiving, duties & tariffs, warranty services, and current overhead rates.
