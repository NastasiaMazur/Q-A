            "  EXHIBIT C     Guidelines for Applications Bundled with Google Applications     Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying  practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called \"drive-by download\"), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google's business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.     For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any  Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google  services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a  Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.     In these Guidelines: (a) \"you\" and \"your\" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) \"Application\" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.

You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the  signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1)  has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with  the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google's approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a  written request.     1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your  Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then  only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page  that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.     2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the  like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive,  fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to \"hacking\" or \"cracking.\"     3.

In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be  provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom)  and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be  designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure  and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.     4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed  pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the  agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from  your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user's use of his or her  computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must  be disclosed in your privacy policy.

Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In  addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in  each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or  Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you  obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user's ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7.

Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as  Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example,  we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any  applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide  such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your  Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would  include providing Google with \"golden masters\" of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to  stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand,  however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and  assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or  bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.     9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the  requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must  also obtain Google's written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google  approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines.  Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.     10. Updates.     10.1 General.

Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a  plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within  ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the \"Maximum Compliance Period\"). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as  Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these  Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in  effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance  during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease  bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the  Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those  Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.

Note that this authorisation may be revoked at any time and  Distributor shall then include the 6 months flag again in future builds.\\n\\n\\n\\n  - 22 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  EXHIBIT C     Guidelines for Applications Bundled with Google Applications     Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying  practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called \"drive-by download\"), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user\\'s  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google\\'s business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.     For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any  Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google  services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a  Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.     In these Guidelines: (a) \"you\" and \"your\" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) \"Application\" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user\\'s computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.    Google Confidential\\n\\n\\n\\n  - 23 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as  appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these  Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.     If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.     Google Confidential\\n\\n\\n\\n  - 24 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   1. General.     1.1 Approval and Ongoing Compliance. You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the  signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1)  has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with  the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google\\'s approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a  written request.     1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your  Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then  only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page  that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.     2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the  like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive,  fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to \"hacking\" or \"cracking.\"     3. Prohibited Behavior. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that engages in deceptive, unfair, harassing or otherwise  annoying practices. For example, the Application may not:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Google Confidential\\n\\n\\n\\n  (a) use, or permit an unaffiliated person to use, an end user\\'s computer system for any purpose not understood and  affirmatively consented to by the end user (including, without limitation, for purposes of consuming bandwidth or  computer resources, sending email messages, launching denial of service attacks, accruing toll charges through a dialer  or obtaining personal information from an end user\\'s computer such as login, password, account or other information  personal to the end user);\\n\\n  (b) intentionally create or exploit any security vulnerabilities in end user computers;\\n\\n  (c) trigger pop-ups, pop-unders, exit windows, or similar obstructive or intrusive functionality, that materially interfere with  an end user\\'s Web navigation or browsing or the use of his or her computer;\\n\\n  (d) repeatedly ask an end user to take, or try to deceive an end user into taking, an action that the end user has previously  declined to take (such as repeatedly asking an end user to change his or her home page or some other setting or  configuration);\\n\\n  - 25 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   4. Disclosure and Consent.     4.1 Disclosure and Consent before Installation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless you (and your  distribution and bundling partners, if applicable under the terms of the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines)  design the installation of any such Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner - e.g., no  \"drive-by\\' downloads or installs. By \"distribution partner\" we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by \"bundling partner\"  we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance  with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   4.2 Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable information. You may not bundle any Google  Application with any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2)  collects or transmits information related to a user\\'s computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user\\'s  personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the first occurrence of any such collection or transmission  you:\\n\\n   Google Confidential\\n\\n\\n\\n  (e) redirect browser traffic away from valid DNS entries (except that your Application may direct unresolved URLs to an  alternative URL designated by you, provided that the page to which the end user resolves adequately informs the end  user that you and your Application are the source of that page);\\n\\n  (f) interfere with the browser default search functionality (except that your Application may permit an end user to change  his or her default search engine with proper disclosure, consent and attribution as provided below); or\\n\\n  (g) engage in activity that violates any applicable Jaw or regulation.\\n\\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users:\\n\\n  (i) that they are installing an application,\\n\\n  (ii) the name of the Application, identifying you as the entity responsible for it, and\\n\\n  (iii) the principal and significant features and functionality of the Application; and\\n\\n  (b) then, obtain the end user\\'s affirmative consent to install the Application.\\n\\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose:\\n\\n  - 26 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   4.3 Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that makes a  change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (e.g., changing the  browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application),  unless prior to making such change you:\\n\\n\\n\\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that  have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu,  and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the  end user.     4.4 Method of Disclosure and Consent. In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be  provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom)  and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be  designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure  and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.     4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed  pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the  agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from  your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user\\'s use of his or her  computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must  be disclosed in your privacy policy.     Google Confidential\\n\\n\\n\\n  (i) the type of information collected (described with specificity in the case of personally identifiable information),\\n\\n  (ii) the method of collection (e.g. by registration, etc.), and\\n\\n  (iii) the location of (i.e., a link to) the privacy policy that governs the collection, use and disclosure of the  information; and\\n\\n  (b) then, obtain the end user\\'s affirmative consent to such collection and/or transmission.\\n\\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose the change in a manner that will explain the practical effect of  such change; and\\n\\n  (b) then, obtain the end user\\'s affirmative consent to make such change.\\n\\n  - 27 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   5. Transparency. Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In  addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in  each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or  Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you  obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user\\'s ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7. Bundling of Applications. In addition to the requirements set forth in the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these  Guidelines, in order for you to bundle any Application with a Google Application must satisfy each of the following requirements:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Google Confidential\\n\\n\\n\\n  (a) the end user is made aware of all of the Applications included in the bundle prior to any installation;\\n\\n  (b) all such Applications included in the bundle or download comply with the provisions of Section 2 through 6 of these  Guidelines;\\n\\n  (c) if Applications in a bundle in which you are participating are supported in part by revenue generated by advertising  displayed in another independent Application included in that bundle and the continued use of the Application is  conditioned on such other independent Application remaining installed and active on the end user\\'s computer, the end  user must be made aware of that relationship; and\\n\\n  - 28 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   8. Information and Assistance. Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as  Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example,  we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any  applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide  such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your  Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would  include providing Google with \"golden masters\" of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to  stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand,  however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and  assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or  bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.     9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the  requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must  also obtain Google\\'s written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google  approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines.  Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.     10. Updates.     10.1 General. As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time; provided,  however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with thirty (30) days\\' written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice (the  date on which you receive such notice, the \"Update Notice Date\"), you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within thirty (30)  days     Google Confidential\\n\\n\\n\\n  (d) either (1) the bundle must provide for a master uninstaller that will enable the end user to uninstall every Application in  the bundle without undue effort or skill, or (2) if no master uninstaller is provided, the de-installation of any Application  may not be dependent or conditioned upon the de-installation of any other Application included in the bundle.\\n\\n  - 29 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  10.2 Extended Compliance Period. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies  with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of  such update (the \"Update Effective Date\"), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any  event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the  Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your  confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a  plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within  ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the \"Maximum Compliance Period\"). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as  Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these  Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in  effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance  during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease  bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the  Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those  Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.

            "  EXHIBIT C     Guidelines for Applications Bundled with Google Applications     Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying  practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called \"drive-by download\"), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google's business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.

In these Guidelines: (a) \"you\" and \"your\" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) \"Application\" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.

Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements.

See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user's ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7.
