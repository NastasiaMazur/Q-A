A first step in this process is the development of a Technology Acquisition Profile. Once completed, we will identify and present technologies that meet this profile. While conducting our search we will maintain the confidentiality of AVDU.\\n\\nTerm: The term of the Agreement will be for 12 months unless terminated sooner. This Agreement may be renewed upon mutual, written agreement of the parties. Either party may terminate this agreement at any time with 30 days written notice.\\n\\nServices: UTK agrees to provide the following distinct services to AVDU:\\n\\n  i. Identify synergistic new technologies from universities and government laboratories to help provide AVDU with an enhanced new product pipeline.\\n\\n  ii. Review technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU while maintaining AVDU\\'s confidentiality.\\n\\n  iii. Present technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU. AVDU will have 30-days to determine if they want to go forward with the technology license.\\n\\n  a. UTK after 30 days shall have the right to present the technology to other clients.\\n\\n  iv. AVDU acknowledges that the sources of technologies represented by UTEK are 3rd party research institutions for which UTEK does not control whether the technology will be shown to other parties by the licensor.\\n\\n  v. At AVDU\\'s request, UTK will prepare, and compile additional information regarding the technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU.\\n\\n  vi. At AVDU\\'s request and upon mutual agreement between AVDU and UTK, UTK will negotiate and seek to acquire a license to the requested technology for subsequent sale to and acquisition by AVDU.\\n\\n  vii. On a case-by-case basis, at AVDU\\'s request and UTK\\'s sole discretion, UTK will propose an equity-financing plan for AVDU\\'s consideration, to finance select technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU.\\n\\n  viii.

The compensation quotation is valid for projects authorized and initiated within 30 days of the date of this term sheet.\\n\\na. In arms length negotiation with the technology developer, UTK will seek to acquire the license to the technology through one of its subsidiaries. UTEK will then negotiate with AVDU to acquire this subsidiary in a stock for stock exchange under an \"Agreement and Plan of Acquisition\". The consideration to be paid by AVDU to UTK will be based upon a markup to the value of the license and other assets in the subsidiary as determined by UTK and agreed to by both parties.\\n\\nb. Should AVDU decide not to proceed in the acquisition of the technology/company as described above, then AVDU shall be prohibited from acquiring the technology/company either directly or indirectly, from the technology/company developer for a period of 24 months following the termination of this Strategic Alliance Agreement.\\n\\nTechnology Transfer: When a technology is shown to AVDU that AVDU wants to acquire, UTK will seek to acquire the license to a technology through one of its subsidiaries. UTK will then seek to provide a term sheet to AVDU outlining the consideration to be paid by AVDU for the acquisition of this technology. UTK shall transfer this subsidiary to AVDU in a stock for stock exchange under an \"Agreement and Plan of Acquisition.\" The consideration to be paid by AVDU to UTK will be based upon a markup to the value of the license and other assets in the subsidiary as determined by UTK and agreed to by both parties.\\n\\nCompensation:\\n\\nIn consideration for providing these Services, AVDU shall pay UTK $120,000 worth of unregistered shares of common stock (31,413 shares) upon the execution of this Strategic Alliance Agreement. 1/12th of the shares (2,617) shall vest each month during the term of this Agreement.
